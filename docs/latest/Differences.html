<!--l. 636--><p class="noindent" >To install OpenCore, replicate the ?? described in the previous section in the EFI volume of a GPT partition. While
corresponding sections of this document provide some information regarding external resources such as ACPI tables, UEFI
drivers, or kernel extensions (kexts), completeness of the matter is out of the scope of this document. Information about kernel
extensions may be found in a separate <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Kexts.md" >Kext List</a> document available in the OpenCore repository. Vaulting information is
provided in the ?? section of this document.
</p><!--l. 648--><p class="noindent" >The OC config file, as with any property list file, can be edited with any text editor, such as nano or vim. However, specialised
software may provide a better experience. On macOS, the preferred GUI application is <a 
href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode" >Xcode</a>. For a lightweight cross-platform
and open-source alternative, the <a 
href="https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree" >ProperTree</a> editor can be utilised.
</p><!--l. 662--><p class="noindent" ><span class="uwave">It is strongly advised not to use any software that is aware of the internal configration structure as it constantly gets out of
date and will cause incorrect configuration to be generated. If it is a must desprite the warning one should make sure to only
use stable versions of OpenCore with explicit support for the particular version in the app. The choice of open-source
implementations with transparent binary generation is encouraged (e.g. </span><a 
href="https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig" ><span class="uwave">OCAT</span></a><span class="uwave">), since other tools may contain malware.
Remember that a configuration made for a different hardware setup shall never be used on another hardware setup.
</span>
</p><!--l. 668--><p class="noindent" >For BIOS booting, a third-party UEFI environment provider is required and OpenDuetPkg is one such UEFI environment
provider for legacy systems. To run OpenCore on such a legacy system, OpenDuetPkg can be installed with a dedicated tool —
BootInstall (bundled with OpenCore). <a 
href="https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS" >Third-party utilities</a> can be used to perform this on systems other than
macOS.
</p><!--l. 675--><p class="noindent" >For upgrade purposes, refer to the Differences.pdf document which provides information about changes to the configuration
(as compared to the previous release) as well as to the Changelog.md document (which contains a list of modifications across
all published updates).

<!--l. 682--><p class="noindent" >OpenCore can be compiled as a standard <a

EDK II release is hosted in <a

directory.
</p><!--l. 690--><p class="noindent" >The only officially supported toolchain is XCODE5. Other toolchains might work but are neither supported nor recommended.
Contributions of clean patches are welcome. Please do follow <a

</p><!--l. 695--><p class="noindent" >To compile with XCODE5, besides <a

<!--l. 764--><p class="noindent" >As with any other project, we have conventions that we follow during development. All third-party contributors are advised to
adhere to the conventions listed below before submitting patches. To minimise abortive work and the potential rejection of
submissions, third-party contributors should initially raise issues to the <a 
href="https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker" >Acidanthera Bugtracker</a> for feedback before submitting
patches.
</p><!--l. 771--><p class="noindent" >Organisation. The codebase is contained in the OpenCorePkg repository, which is the primary EDK II package.
</p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Whenever changes are required in multiple repositories, separate pull requests should be sent to each.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Committing the changes should happen firstly to dependent repositories, secondly to primary repositories to
     avoid automatic build errors.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Each unique commit should compile with XCODE5 and preferably with other toolchains. In the majority of the
     cases it can be checked by accessing the <a 
href="https://travis-ci.com/acidanthera" >CI interface</a>. Ensuring that static analysis finds no warnings is preferred.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">External pull requests and tagged commits must be validated. That said, commits in master may build but may
     not necessarily work.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Internal branches should be named as follows: author-name-date, e.g. vit9696-ballooning-20191026.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Commit messages should be prefixed with the primary module (e.g. library or code module) the changes were
     made in. For example, OcGuardLib: Add OC_ALIGNED macro. For non-library changes Docs or Build prefixes
     are used.</li></ul>
<!--l. 792--><p class="noindent" >Design. The codebase is written in a subset of freestanding C11 (C17) supported by most modern toolchains used by EDK II.
Applying common software development practices or requesting clarification is recommended if any particular case is not
discussed below. </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Never rely on undefined behaviour and try to avoid implementation defined behaviour unless explicitly covered
     below (feel free to create an issue when a relevant case is not present).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Use OcGuardLib to ensure safe integral arithmetics avoiding overflows. Unsigned wraparound should be relied
     on with care and reduced to the necessary amount.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Check  pointers  for  correct  alignment  with  OcGuardLib and  do  not  rely  on  the  architecture  being  able  to
     dereference unaligned pointers.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Use flexible array members instead of zero-length or one-length arrays where necessary.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Use static assertions (STATIC_ASSERT) for type and value assumptions, and runtime assertions (ASSERT) for
     precondition and invariant sanity checking. Do not use runtime assertions to check for errors as they should never
     alter control flow and potentially be excluded.
     </li>
